# NumPy Art Generator

This Python script allows you to create custom art or images using NumPy and display them using Matplotlib. It's a simple and fun way to generate colorful patterns and designs.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

2. Install the required libraries, NumPy and Matplotlib, if you haven't already. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. Open the `numpy_art_generator.py` script in your favorite code editor or IDE.

4. Customize the script to create your desired art or image. You can modify the following parameters:

   - `width` and `height`: Adjust the size of the canvas by changing the width and height values.
   - `colors`: Define the colors you want to use in your art. You can add or modify colors by changing the RGB values.
   - `squares`: Define the positions and sizes of the squares you want to create on the canvas. You can add or modify squares by changing the (x, y, width, height) values.

5. Run the script by executing it in your Python environment:

   ```bash
   python numpy_art_generator.py
   ```

6. The script will generate your custom art and display it using Matplotlib.

7. You can save the generated image by right-clicking on the Matplotlib window and selecting "Save Image."
